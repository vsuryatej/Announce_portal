# Internal Announcement & Communication Portal

A full-stack portal where **authors** publish organization-wide announcements and **readers** browse, filter, and acknowledge them. The system tracks per-user read state and explicit acknowledgments, with author-only analytics on engagement.

## Quick start (< 10 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 2. Database setup

**Always run these from the `server` folder** (or use `npm run db:setup` from the project root):

```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run db:seed
```

This creates `server/prisma/dev.db` and seeds demo accounts.

**If login fails or you see “database” errors**, reset everything:

```bash
cd server
npm run db:reset
```

Verify the connection:

```bash
cd server
npm run db:check
```

You should see: `OK — connected. Users in database: 2` (or more).

### Prisma Studio (database UI)

Prisma Studio defaults to port **5555**. This project uses **5556** so it does not clash with anything else on 5555.

```bash
cd server
npm run db:studio
```

Then open [http://localhost:5556](http://localhost:5556) in your browser.

To use another port: `npx prisma studio --port 4000`

### 3. Run the app

**Terminal 1 — API (port 5000):**

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 — UI (port 5173):**

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Demo accounts

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| `author@company.com` | `password123` | AUTHOR |
| `reader@company.com` | `password123` | READER |

New registrations default to **READER**. To promote a user to author, update `role` to `AUTHOR` in the database (e.g. `npx prisma studio`).

## Tech stack & rationale

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| **API** | Node.js + Express 5 | Fast to build REST endpoints; familiar middleware model |
| **ORM / DB** | Prisma + **SQLite** | Zero external services for reviewers; file persists across restarts; easy local setup |
| **Auth** | JWT (7-day) + **bcrypt** (10 rounds) | Stateless sessions for SPA; passwords never stored in plain text |
| **UI** | React 19 + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4 | Fast HMR, simple component model, utility styling |
| **Routing** | react-router-dom | Protected routes, author-only sections |

SQLite is ideal for a take-home demo. For production, switch the Prisma datasource to PostgreSQL with the same schema.

```

**Key flows**

- **Publish**: Draft → `PATCH /:id/publish` sets `publishedAt` once.
- **Read**: Opening a published announcement upserts a `Read` row.
- **Acknowledge**: Explicit `POST /:id/acknowledge` (idempotent); required when `requiresAck` is true.
- **List**: Combinable filters, case-insensitive title search (SQLite `LOWER`), pinned-first sort, pagination.

---

## How AI tools were used

- **Cursor (Claude)** was used to scaffold the Prisma schema, Express routes, and React pages from the assignment specification.
- AI-generated code was reviewed for: draft visibility rules, immutability after publish, idempotent acknowledgments, and author-only analytics.
- Hand-edited areas: seed credentials, README, proxy config, and UX copy.
- Surprising fix: SQLite lacks Prisma `insensitive` mode — title search uses a small raw SQL fragment for case-insensitive matching.

---

## Assumptions

- Single organization (no multi-tenancy).
- All registered users are employees; “pending acknowledgment” = all users minus those who acknowledged.
- Authors are created via **seed** or manual DB update; registration does not auto-grant author.
- JWT in `localStorage` is acceptable for this demo (not production-hardened).
- Plain-text announcement bodies (no rich text or attachments).

---

## Trade-offs (6-hour budget)

- **SQLite** instead of Postgres — simpler ops, sufficient for hundreds of announcements.
- **JWT** instead of server sessions — less infrastructure; logout is client-side token removal.
- **Minimal UI polish** — focus on correct flows over design system.
- No real-time updates, email notifications, or CSV export.
- No automated test suite.

---

## Future work

- Postgres + connection pooling for production
- httpOnly cookie sessions
- Email notifications for ack-required posts
- CSV export of acknowledgment lists
- Markdown rendering for bodies
- Admin UI to promote readers to authors
- Docker Compose for one-command startup
